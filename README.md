# Workout Tracker  
This is the week seventeen homework for the University of Richmond
Coding Boot Camp.  The front end code has been provided by the Boot Camp, 
and I provided the back end code to make the app do its magic.  

The Workout Tracker is an app that the user can input workouts and exercises to 
track, and view his/her stats by the current week.
